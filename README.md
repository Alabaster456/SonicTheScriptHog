SonicTheScriptHog
=================

Yes, you read it right! Sonic The Scripthog! This is going to be a copy of the actual 'Sonic The Hedgehog' game created out of Javascript, Jquery and HTML/CSS. It's going to be 2D just like the good ol' days!

*For future reference,*
I take no copyright in images, levels or any other stuff that may be displayed in this game. All credits go to the people who drew Sonic and the mastermind Sega. If problems may occur, I will immediately remove them when informed.

Ideas & Questions:

1. How will the player react to an object standing in front of him/her?
2. Will the player be able to run faster or just at an standard, medium pace?
3. A jump button should be enabled, as well as a ending goal for the user.
4. Sound should be inputted! (See about this)
5. The user should be able to play Sonic AND **Knuckles** perhaps?
  6. There should be a Sonic loading screen (like back in the old days), so that the user can select play or indulge into how to play (FINISHED).

P.S Your ideas, suggestions or whatever they may be will be added to the list (above).

---------------------

NOTE
-------------

You have to have knowledge in one of these four languages though, them being:

1. **HTML**
2. **JavaScript**
3. **CSS**
4. **Jquery**
